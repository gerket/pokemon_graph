# pokemon_graph

This is a small project that demonstrates Dash and python apps online by using a multi-select dropdown box along with a dynamically updating graph. It incorporates pandas, API calls, and plotly.  

This is deployed at [https://pokemon-graph.herokuapp.com/](https://pokemon-graph.herokuapp.com/). It may be a little slow due to heroku or the api (which limits the number of calls) but it works well locally.
